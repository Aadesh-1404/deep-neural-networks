# Deep-Neural-Networks-Model---Keras-Tensorflow-
Understood the basics of the deep neural networks. Build the DNN models FCNN, CNN and RESENT50 in keras & tensorflow. Tested the models built on the following datasets:<br />
<br />
    1. From keras.datasets imported MNIST dataset which contains images of handwritten digits and has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. A three dense layered Fully Connected Neural Network model was build and the model was tested by this dataset. <br />
    2. From keras.datasets imported CIFAR-10 dataset which contains colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test            images. A Convolutional Neural Networks model comrising of three convolutional layers and two dense layers was built and the CIFAR-10 dataset was tested on this model.<br />
    3. Locally imported the Hand-sign Dataset in .h5 format using the h5py package. There are a total 1080 images in the train data and 120 images in the test data, each of which is a 3 channel image of dimension 64x64. A deep learning neural network, ResNet-50 was made to recognize numeric signs using our hand and the model was tested on the above mentioned dataset. <br />
